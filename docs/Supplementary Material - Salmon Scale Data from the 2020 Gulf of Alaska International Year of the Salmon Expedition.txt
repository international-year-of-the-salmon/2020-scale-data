Salmon Scale Data Collection and Processing Protocols from the 2020 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition

To estimate the marine age of salmon, scale analysis was done onboard for Sockeye salmon, Chum salmon, and Chinook salmon. Since Coho salmon and Pink salmon spend only one winter in the ocean, their scales were not analysed. Several scales of each fish (2-4) were placed between two microscope slides. Photos of scale samples for fish larger than 35 cm fork length (FL) were taken through a microscope. Marine age was estimated by counting ocean annuli separated by narrow, closely-spaced circuli. Salmon less than 35 cm FL were assumed to be first ocean winter. Salmon that are caught in the trawl net lose many of their scales which results in most scale samples not taken from the preferred area (above or below lateral line between dorsal and anal fins). Consequently, it was not possible to estimate freshwater age and only marine age was distinguished. Thus, for species that spend several years in both freshwater and ocean (Sockeye salmon, Chinook salmon) age was defined as n.1, n.2 etc., where n – is unidentified freshwater age, and digit – marine age. The age of Chum salmon, which spend less than one year in freshwater, was defined as 0.1, 0.2, etc.
